# nyc-collisions

The initial aim was to come up with something smart about using the NYC collisions dataset but my laptop and my (improving) knowledge of the machine-learning concepts gave me strong limitations.

The final part of the notebook contains some interesting insights about collisions in the City that never sleeps plus which is the _deadliest hour_? Feel free to check the notebook.
